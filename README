this is a moving mesh code written mostly in python 2.7 and cython.
In order to run the code you will need the following libraries
(I used the following versions)

python 2.7 (not compatible with python 3)
numpy 1.13.1
scipy
matplotlib (+ qt4)
cython 0.25.2
mpi4py 2.0.0
cgal 4.06.3

Can be installed by
pip install -e .

* I will soon list code issues 


On a Fedora system, the needed libraries can be installed as:

```
dnf install CGAL CGAL-devel swig
dnf install python2-devel python2-Cython
dnf install python2-mpi4py-mpich
dnf install python2-numpy python2-scipy python2-matplotlib python2-matplotlib-qt4
```
