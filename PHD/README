History of this code so far. Originally I had a serial version working in
2d and 3d. Since then I have started working on a parallel version. Hence
there are many parts of the program that no longer work. The majority of
parallel version has been in the load_balance directory. You can run
(assuming you have mpi and mpi4py installed) global_mesh.py by

mpirun -n 4 python global_mesh.py

which creates random particles in a unit box for each process and then
performs a load balance and creates initial ghost particles. The script
uses the following directories:

- load_balance
- particles
- utilities
- hilbert
- mesh 

For load_balance, utilities, and hilbert there is cython code that you
will have to compile separately by

python setup.py build_ext --inplace

in each directory. In the future I will place all cython builds in one setup.py
script.
